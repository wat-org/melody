To solve this issue, declare the missing XML Attribute.

TaskFactoryEx_ATTR_DUPLICATE=''{0}'': Duplicate Task Attribute Setter Method. \
The Task Attribute Setter for ''{0}'' is already associated to the method ''{1}'', and for this reason, cannot be associated to the method ''{2}''. \
To solve this issue, remove the ''{3}'' annotation of one of these method, \
or change the Name of the ''{3}'' annotation of one of these method.

TaskFactoryEx_ATTR_SPEC_CONFLICT=The method ''{0}'' of the class ''{1}'' is not a valid setter for the Task''s Attribute ''{2}''. \
This method doesn''t respect Task Attribute specifications.

TaskFactoryEx_INVALID_TEXT=XML Text Content is not accepted. \
To solve this issue, remove the XML Text Content.

TaskFactoryEx_MANDATORY_TEXT_NOT_FOUND=Mandatory XML Text Content is missing. \
To solve this issue, declare the missing XML Text Content.

TaskFactoryEx_TEXT_DUPLICATE=Duplicate Task Text Content Setter Method. \
The Task Text Content Setter is already associated to the method ''{0}'', and for this reason, cannot be associated to the method ''{1}''. \
To solve this issue, remove the ''{2}'' annotation of one of these method.

TaskFactoryEx_TEXT_SPEC_CONFLICT=The method ''{0}'' of the class ''{1}'' is not a valid Text setter. \
This method doesn''t respect Task Text Content specifications.

TaskFactoryEx_INVALID_NE=XML Nested Element ''{0}'' is not accepted. \
To solve this issue, remove this XML Nested Element.

TaskFactoryEx_MANDATORY_NE_NOT_FOUND=The mandatory XML Nested Element ''{0}'' is missing. \
To solve this issue, declare the missing XML Nested Element.

TaskFactoryEx_NO_CONSTRUCTOR_MATCH=Cannot find a public constructor for the class ''{0}'' which accept a sole parameter of type String.

TaskFactoryEx_NE_DUPLICATE=''{0}'': Duplicate Task Nested Element Setter Method. \
The Task Nested Element Setter for ''{0}'' is already associated to the method ''{1}'', and for this reason, cannot be associated to the method ''{2}''. \
To solve this issue, remove the ''{3}'' annotation of one of these method, \
or change the Name of the ''{3}'' annotation of one of these method.

TaskFactoryEx_ADD_NE_SPEC_CONFLICT=The method ''{0}'' is not a valid method to add the task''s Nested Element ''{1}''. \
This method doesn''t respect Task Nested Element specifications.

TaskFactoryEx_CREATE_NE_SPEC_CONFLICT=The method ''{0}'' is not a valid method to create the task''s Nested Element ''{1}''. \
This method doesn''t respect Task Nested Element specifications.

TaskFactoryEx_CONVERT_ATTR=''{0}'': Not accepted. Cannot be converted to ''{1}''.

TaskFactoryEx_CONVERT_ATTR_TO_ENUM=''{0}'': Not accepted. Accepted values are {1}.

TaskFactoryEx_EXPAND_ATTR=XML Attribute ''{0}'' expanded <{1}>.

TaskFactoryEx_SET_ATTR=XML Attribute ''{0}'' set <{1}>.
TaskFactoryEx_EXPAND_TEXT=XML Text Content expanded <{0}>.
TaskFactoryEx_CREATE_TEXT=XML Text Content created <{0}>.
TaskFactoryEx_SET_TEXT=XML Text Content set <{0}>.
TaskFactoryEx_SET_NE=XML Element ''{0}'' created <{1}>.


TaskEx_INIT_FINAL_STATE=Task ''{0}'' created <{1}>.
TaskEx_PROCESS_FINAL_STATE=Task ''{0}'' finished <{1}>.


TargetEx_NOT_MATCH_ELEMENT=''{0}'': Not accepted. This expression targets - at least - a ''{1}'' node. Since this expression doesn''t only targets Element Node, such expression is not accepted.


ProcMgrEx_MAX_PAR=''{0}'': Not accepted. Must be a positive Integer.

ProcMgrEx_UNDEF_MANDOTORY_DIRECTIVE=Processor Manager is not correctly configured. The ''{0}'' must be defined.

ProcMgrEx_PROCESS_FINAL_STATE=Processing finished <{0}>.


OrderEx_DUPLICATE=''{0}'': Not accepted. This OrderName have already been set.

OrderEx_UNDEF=''{0}'': Not accepted. This OrderName cannot be found the Sequence Descriptor.


PMFactoryEx_UNDEF_ENV={0} failed to instantiate a {1} because no {1} implementation is defined. \
You should set an environment variable ''{2}'' and assign it the canonical class name of a {1} implementation.

PMFactoryEx_CLASS_NOT_FOUND=Unknown Java Class ''{0}''. \
To solve this issue, either correct this Java Class Name so that it matches a valid {1} implementation, \
or add the jar file which hold this missing Java Class to the ClassPath.

PMFactoryEx_NO_CLASS_DEF_FOUND=The Java Class ''{0}'' import an unknown Java Class ''{1}''. \
To solve this issue, add the jar file which hold this missing Java Class to the ClassPath.

PMFactoryEx_INVALID_SPEC=The Java Class ''{0}'' is not a valid Processor Manager Class. \
A Processor Manager Class must be a public and non abstract class, must implement the {1} interface at any degree and must have a 0-arg constructor.

PMFactoryEx_INTERNAL_ERROR=The Java Class ''{0}'' is not a valid Processor Manager Class. \
This Processor Manager Class initialization fails, generating the error below.
